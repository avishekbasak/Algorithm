In this problem, I declared two variables min and max. Initialized min with positive infinity and max with negative infinity.
For every element in array if the number is less than min, replace min value and if the number is greater than max value, replace max value.

Time Complexity: O(n) since I have to iterate complete array to determine max and min value.
Space: O(1) to store min and max value
